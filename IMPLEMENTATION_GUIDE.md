# Implementation Guide for Tixify

## Coding Practices
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces or 4 spaces)
- Comment critical sections of code
- Write modular functions

## GitHub Workflow
- Create feature branches for each task (e.g., feature-buy-ticket)
- Commit regularly with meaningful messages (e.g., "Added Buy Ticket function")
- Pull latest main branch before pushing changes
- Conduct peer code reviews

## Smart Contracts
- Use OpenZeppelin's ERC721 implementation
- Write constructor to initialize event details
- Add functions: buyTicket(), transferTicket()
